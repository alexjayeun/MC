 <div class="paragraph"><h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am part of this year's amazing cohort at MotherCoders, a Google-backed tech orientation program for moms. My 30-year goal is to help pave the way for mainstreaming new field of public interest design across the globe, and I am convinced that systematic change needed to make this happen at all levels of society is through tech and design.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, I grew up in New Zealand (Aotearoa) where I got my PhD in Architecture studying Design Thinking--an idea now widely used in business strategy and management, was initially developed to promote democratic decision-making--and I became interested in how Design Thinking can be applied to evaluate social crises following major catastrophes. I conducted fieldwork in post-Katrina New Orleans, post-earthquake Haiti, and sat through my fair share of 5.0+ earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand. I came to the US in 2014 as a visiting research scholar at UC Berkeley to complete my postdoc and published my first book: "Resilience by Design" (Springer: 2016).</p>
    <p>Building empathy and communicating effectively across multiple stakeholders is essential, not just when we are in deep crisis, but everyday. For over 7 years I co-founded and ran an active satellite chapter of an international design non-profit Architecture for Humanity. My community's needs shaped my own design practice during those years (and still do). Whether through teaching, making, facilitating, or consulting, I enjoyed finding creative application of design principles in non-traditional settings. This is how I realized that my traditional architectural background can easily transfer outside of the institutional boundary, and to some extent, must, for there is a huge shortage of creative folks who also make things.</p>
    <p>Design is essential for communicating with the world. And I am up for the challenge.</p>
